## ðŸš€ **Quick Start - Frontend First**

### **Step 1: Deploy Frontend to Vercel**

```powershell
# 1. Prepare your code
cd D:\Kursor
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy to Vercel"
git push origin main

# 2. Go to vercel.com and connect your GitHub repo
# 3. Select 'kursor-editor' folder as root
# 4. Deploy!
```

**Your website will be live at**: `https://your-app.vercel.app`

### **Step 2: Setup Free Database**

1. Go to https://neon.tech
2. Sign up with GitHub
3. Create database "kursor"
4. Copy the connection string
5. Use it in Vercel environment variables

### **Step 3: Get API Keys (All FREE)**

- **Judge0**: https://rapidapi.com/judge0-official/api/judge0-ce (50 requests/day)
- **Resend**: https://resend.com (100 emails/month)
- **Google OAuth**: https://console.cloud.google.com (unlimited)

## ðŸ’¡ **Alternative: All-in-One Approach**

Instead of microservices, let's combine everything into your Next.js app for FREE deployment:

### **Option A: Vercel Only (Recommended for FREE)**

- Deploy your `kursor-editor` as-is to Vercel
- Use built-in API routes instead of microservices
- Everything runs on Vercel's free tier
- Database: Neon PostgreSQL (free)

### **Option B: Single Service on Railway**

- Combine all microservices into one
- Deploy to Railway (within $5 free credit)
- Frontend still on Vercel

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **Let's Start Simple**

**Which approach do you prefer?**

1. **Deploy frontend to Vercel first** (5 minutes, completely free)
2. **Combine services into one** for Railway free tier
3. **Deploy microservices separately** (may exceed free limits)

**I recommend starting with Option 1** - get your frontend live first, then we can add the backend!
