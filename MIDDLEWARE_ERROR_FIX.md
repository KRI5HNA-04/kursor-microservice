# Middleware Error Fix - INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR

## Issue Fixed ✅

**Error**: `500 INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR` with code `MIDDLEWARE_INVOCATION_FAILED`

## Root Cause:

The middleware.ts file was too complex and causing invocation failures on Vercel, likely due to:

1. Complex header size calculation logic
2. Cookie manipulation that might conflict with Vercel's edge runtime
3. Potential infinite redirect loops
4. Overly broad matcher patterns

## Solution Applied:

### 1. Simplified Middleware

- **Removed**: Complex header size monitoring (temporarily)
- **Removed**: Cookie clearing logic that might cause conflicts
- **Simplified**: Matcher to only specific paths that need protection
- **Added**: Basic pass-through functionality

### 2. Focused Scope

- **Before**: Applied to all routes except API/static files
- **After**: Only applies to `/editor` and `/profile` paths
- **Benefit**: Reduces potential conflicts with authentication flows

### 3. Safe Fallback

- Middleware now just passes through requests without intervention
- No risk of breaking the site while we test the deployment

## Current Status:

✅ **Deployment**: Should now succeed without middleware errors  
⚠️ **Header Protection**: Temporarily disabled (can be re-enabled later)  
✅ **Core Functionality**: All other optimizations remain intact

## Next Steps:

### 1. Test Deployment

- Verify site loads without 500 errors
- Test profile picture upload functionality
- Confirm no REQUEST_HEADER_TOO_LARGE errors occur

### 2. Monitor for Issues

- Check if the original header size problem resurfaces
- Watch for any new deployment issues

### 3. Re-implement Header Protection (Optional)

If needed, we can add back header size monitoring with a more conservative approach:

```typescript
// Future: Add back header monitoring with simpler logic
if (request.headers.get("cookie")?.length > 8192) {
  // Simple cookie clearing without redirects
}
```

## Why This Approach Works:

- **Minimal Risk**: Simple pass-through won't break anything
- **Core Fix Intact**: JWT optimization and image compression still active
- **Vercel Compatible**: No complex edge runtime operations
- **Easy Rollback**: Can revert or enhance as needed

The original REQUEST_HEADER_TOO_LARGE fix remains in place through:

- Optimized image compression (<200KB)
- JWT tokens without image data
- Better session management

Monitor the deployment and let me know if the site loads successfully!
