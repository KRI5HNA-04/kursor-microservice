# REQUEST_HEADER_TOO_LARGE Error Fix

## Problem

Users were experiencing a "494 REQUEST_HEADER_TOO_LARGE" error, which occurs when HTTP request headers exceed the server's size limit (typically 8KB).

## Root Causes

- Large cookies, especially NextAuth session tokens
- Accumulated cookies over time
- Long authorization headers
- Large profile images stored in JWT tokens

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Next.js Configuration** (`next.config.ts`)

- Added headers configuration to handle larger headers
- Set appropriate header size limits

### 2. **Authentication Optimization** (`lib/auth.ts`)

- Optimized JWT token size by limiting image URLs
- Added custom cookie configuration with appropriate expiration times
- Reduced token payload size by truncating long values
- Implemented better image URL handling (using shorter avatar URLs)

### 3. **Cookie Management** (`lib/cookieUtils.ts`)

- Created utility functions to detect and clear large cookies
- Added functions to monitor total cookie size
- Implemented NextAuth-specific cookie cleanup

### 4. **Middleware** (`middleware.ts`)

- Added request header size monitoring
- Automatic cookie cleanup for oversized headers
- Graceful handling of large header requests
- Redirect to login when session cookies are cleared

### 5. **Client-Side Monitoring** (`app/Components/HeaderSizeMonitor.tsx`)

- Real-time header size monitoring
- Automatic cleanup of problematic cookies
- User-friendly error handling with option to clear all data
- Periodic cleanup every 5 minutes

### 6. **API Endpoint** (`app/api/clear-cookies/route.ts`)

- Server-side cookie clearing endpoint
- Header size analysis endpoint
- Comprehensive cookie cleanup for both development and production

### 7. **Vercel Configuration** (`vercel.json`)

- Edge-level configuration for better header handling
- Security headers implementation
- API route optimization

## How It Works

1. **Prevention**: Optimized JWT tokens and cookie sizes
2. **Detection**: Middleware and client-side monitoring detect large headers
3. **Cleanup**: Automatic removal of problematic cookies
4. **Recovery**: Graceful fallback with user notification

## User Experience

- **Transparent**: Most users won't notice the cleanup happening
- **Graceful**: If cleanup is needed, users get a friendly prompt
- **Automatic**: Background monitoring prevents future occurrences
- **Fast**: Minimal impact on application performance

## Testing

To test the fix:

1. Check browser developer tools → Application → Cookies
2. Monitor network requests for 494 errors
3. Use the `/api/clear-cookies` endpoint to get header size info

## Maintenance

The system includes:

- Automatic periodic cleanup
- Logging of large header incidents
- Configurable size thresholds
- Development vs production optimizations

This comprehensive solution should resolve the REQUEST_HEADER_TOO_LARGE errors for your users while maintaining a smooth user experience.
